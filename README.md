# Behavioral Map Extended Study

Before running the Behavioral, you need to install Neo4J Desktop. You can do the **download** the Neo4J Desktop on this website https://neo4j.com/download/?ref=try-neo4j-lp.

The folder **Neo4J APOC Configuration** stores the APOC API configuration file.
**Neo4J and APOC configuration.pdf** file describes how to create a local database and APOC configuration process.

We provide all Configuration Rules (CR) files that can be used to create the Behavioral Map and look for Architectural Smell using the scripts are available in the folder **Behavioral Map scripts**.

Scripts available in the folder **Behavioral Map scripts**:
- **import-cr-file-and-create-the-behavioral-map.cypher**: Script used to import CR file and create the Behavioral Map.
- **hub-like-dependency.cypher**: Used to look for Hub-Like Dependency architectural smell in the configuration.
- **cyclic-dependency.cypher**: Used to look for Cyclic Ddependency smell in the configuration.
- **extraneous-connector.cypher**: Used to look for Extraneous Connector architectural smell in the configuration.
- **look-for-extraneous-connector-between-controllers-and-sensors.cypher**: Used to look for Extraneous Connector between Controllers and Sensors in the Behavioral Map.
- **look-for-oppressed-monitors.cypher** Used to look for Oppressed Monitors in the configuration.
- **get-all-features-in-the-map.cypher**: Used to get all features and their relationship on the map.
- **delete-the-graph.cypher**: Used to delete all maps in the database.

**How to use the Behavioral Map**: 
- Execute the script in the file import-cr-file-and-create-the-behavioral-map.cypher to import the CR file and create the map.
- To look for Cyclic Ddependency smell, execute the script cyclic-dependency.cypher.
- To look for Hub-Like Dependency smell, execute the script hub-like-dependency.cypher.
- To look for Oppressed Monitors smell, execute the script look-for-oppressed-monitors.cypher.
- To look for Extraneous Connector smell, execute the script extraneous-connector.cypher or look-for-extraneous-connector-between-controllers-and-sensors.cypher.
- To see all features and their relationship on the map, execute the script get-all-features-in-the-map.cypher.
- To delete the map, execute the delete-the-graph.cypher.
